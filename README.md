# Real-Time_Obstacle_Detection_Using_UltraSonic_Sensor
As a part of Embedded System Design (ESD) Lab project!!  

The Real-Time Obstacle Detection System is an embedded solution designed using the LPC1768 microcontroller to measure distances and detect obstacles in real-time. Using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, the system calculates obstacle distances and provides both visual and auditory feedback through an LCD screen, LEDs, and a buzzer. This project showcases the capability of embedded systems for applications in robotics, assistive technologies, and industrial safety systems by delivering accurate distance measurements and alerts for critical proximity conditions.
